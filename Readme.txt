Smart Health-Aware Shopping Cart

Overview:
The Smart Health-Aware Shopping Cart is an AI-powered system designed to promote healthy shopping habits. 
It integrates Google Teachable Machine and TensorFlow.js to identify grocery items in real time, classify them as healthy, unhealthy, or neutral, 
and calculate a dynamic health score for the cart. The goal is to assist users in making informed choices while shopping.

Key Features:
- Real-time item detection through webcam.
- AI-powered classification using Teachable Machine & TensorFlow.js.
- Automatic health score calculation for the shopping cart.
- Categorization of items into healthy, unhealthy, and neutral groups.
- Live cart view with healthy/unhealthy counters.
- Clean and responsive user interface.

Technology Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- AI Frameworks: TensorFlow.js, Teachable Machine.
- Supporting Libraries: @tensorflow/tfjs, @teachablemachine/image.

Working Mechanism:
1. A pre-trained AI model from Teachable Machine is loaded.
2. The system activates the webcam and scans items.
3. The AI model predicts the item label with a confidence score.
4. Items are categorized and added to the cart dynamically.
5. The sidebar updates the cart health score, total item count, and healthy/unhealthy breakdown.
